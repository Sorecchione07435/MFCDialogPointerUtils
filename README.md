# MFC Dialog Pointer Utils

DialogPointerUtils is a library that allows you to manage almost any MFC control in a dialog using functions that return a pointer, given the ID of the control. This approach greatly simplifies the management of controls in MFC dialogs, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. It also allows you to use controls without having to create specific control variables, making it easier to use them directly and immediately.

This is a static library that can be included in any Visual C++ Win32 project especially in a dialog box
